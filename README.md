### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name isIsaac Ferraro. I am a General Assembly (GA) graduate, as well as an Olympic College graduate. In early 2020, before I had completed my Associate of Science Degree, I decided I would attend GAâ€™s twelve-week Software Engineering Immersive course. From August to November 2021, I attended and completed this course, gaining practical full-stack development skills. Presently, I plan to use this new knowledge to build and iterate upon web applications, especially on the front-end. Here, you'll find both my GA and personal projects.
